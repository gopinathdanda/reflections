Lesson 3
+++++++++++++++++++

1. GITHUB
------------------
Push or pull commits to or from the remote repo (hosted on Github) on to local.
Its acts on a branch (i.e. works upward along parents).

2. REMOTE
------------------
git remote [-v] -> shows the remotes in the current project
git remote add remote_name remote_url -> add a remote

3. PUSH AND PULL
-------------------
git push remote_name branch_name -> push to branch on the remote
git pull remote_name branch_name -> pull from branch on the remote

4. FORK, CLONES AND BRANCH
-------------------
Fork clones in Github itself (Github feature).
Clone from existing repo to a new place.
Branch in a repo.

5. CONFLICT RESOLUTION ON REMOTE AND LOCAL
-------------------
If the remote and local has been updated simultaneously, conflicts may arise.
git fetch origin -> create a branch at the origin/master branch (where last synced with remote) and add all the commits made at remote.
git pull origin master = 
  git fetch origin
  git merge master origin/master

6. FAST FORWARD MERGE
-------------------
If the two commits are such that we can reach the old commit from the new one (through ancestry), then updating the label to the old 
label is same as merging.
