Lesson 3
+++++++++++++++++++

1. GITHUB
------------------
Push or pull commits to or from the remote repo (hosted on Github) on to local.
Its acts on a branch (i.e. works upward along parents).

2. REMOTE
------------------
git remote [-v] -> shows the remotes in the current project
git remote add remote_name remote_url -> add a remote

3. PUSH AND PULL
-------------------
git push remote_name branch_name -> push to branch on the remote
git pull remote_name branch_name -> pull from branch on the remote

4. FORK, CLONES AND BRANCH
-------------------
Fork clones in Github itself (Github feature).
Clone from existing repo to a new place.
Branch in a repo.

5. CONFLICT RESOLUTION ON REMOTE AND LOCAL
-------------------
If the remote and local has been updated simultaneously, conflicts may arise.
git fetch origin -> create a branch at the origin/master branch (where last synced with remote) and add all the commits made at remote.
git pull origin master = 
  git fetch origin
  git merge master origin/master

6. FAST FORWARD MERGE
-------------------
If the two commits are such that we can reach the old commit from the new one (through ancestry), then updating the label to the old 
label is same as merging.

7. MERGE PULL REQUEST
-------------------
On Github, when you are working on a project with another contributor, in case you want to add a new feature
1. Create a new branch
2. Change, commit and push (the branch, not master)
3. The owner of the repo will be able to check the Pull Request on the Github
4. If he/she is satisfied, he/she can accept the request and merge pull request (with the master)
5. If he/she is not satisfied, he/she can leave an inline or overall comment message. You can then edit the mistake, commit and push again.
This is to make sure you don't merge the master without any scrutiny from contributors.
The formula:
CREATE A BRANCH, MAKE A CHANGE, PUSH THE BRANCH
CHECK THE BRANCH AND MERGE THE BRANCH
In case of conflicts, pull the master onto local, resolve conflict, make a fresh commit on your branch, and push branch
The admin will check the branch and decide on merging the pull request
