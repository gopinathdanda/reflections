LESSON 1
----------------

1. How did diff between two versions help you spot the bug?

diff -u game_old.js game_new.js (Mac/Linux)
fc game_old.js game_new.js (Win)

Showed diff b/w files with line nos.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Lets us know where we went wrong (last working project)
git log
git diff 123456 789012

3. Commit logically and in pieces.

4. Multiple file changes. Repo - collection of files.
git log --stat (git log with all statistics)

5. 
git --version
git clone https://url.com/something.git
git config --global color.ui auto (Set color in diff for easier analysis)
git log and git diff can be used to see and compare.

6.
git checkout ID -> helps in checking out previous commits and look for bugs
Then "git diff" to see the bug
git checkout original_commit -> to get back
