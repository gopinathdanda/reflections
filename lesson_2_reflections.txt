Lesson 2
----------

1.
git init -> to initialize
git status -> to get status and list of files having untracked changes

2.
git add <file1> <file2> -> adds file to staging area. Lets us group files to be bundled into a commit.
git reset -> unstage all files

3.
git checkout master -> go back to master (leave detached HEAD)

git diff -> difference between working dir and staging area
git diff --staged -> difference between staging area and repo
git diff commit1 commit2 -> difference between the two commits

git reset --hard -> unstage all files and remove all changes in working directory (IRREVERSIBLE!!!)
