Lesson 2
----------

1.
git init -> to initialize
git status -> to get status and list of files having untracked changes

2.
git add <file1> <file2> -> adds file to staging area. Lets us group files to be bundled into a commit.
git reset -> unstage all files

3.
git checkout master -> go back to master (leave detached HEAD)

git diff -> difference between working dir and staging area
git diff --staged -> difference between staging area and repo
git diff commit1 commit2 -> difference between the two commits

git reset --hard -> unstage all files and remove all changes in working directory (IRREVERSIBLE!!!)

4. 
Branch to try out new stuff. Can be later merged. For branching, LABELS should be used.
git branch -> show all branches and the current branch I am on
git branch label -> create branch with label at the current checkout point

Must be careful. All commits can point to only its parent. As a result, branching without labels can make a commit inaccessible.
